    ```
3. Install the dependencies:

## Usage

If the 3D model on the homepage seems to small, switch subsides and the problem should be fixed. Furthermore this is a placeholder model. The fins are being clipped, which is fine for the time.

To start the frontend:
    ```
    npx nx serve frontend
    ```
